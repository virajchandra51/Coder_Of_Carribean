You have REACHED the Final Coin in the Treasure, but oh oh, it has n locks.

Find 3 lock values sum to 2023, to open the treasure.

The first line of input contains an integer 𝑛 — the number of locks on the treasure box. (1<=n<=10e3)
The following set of N lines of input contains:
- K, the lock value

Note that the test cases are genereted in such a way that there is only one unique answer possible.

For example, suppose your input contained the following:

INPUT
6
1721
979
369
299
675
1456

OUTPUT
243844425

Using the above example again, the three lock values that sum to 2023 are 979, 369, and 675. Multiplying them together produces the answer, 243844425.

Find the product of the three lock values that sum to "2023".

Your puzzle answer was 262871040.
