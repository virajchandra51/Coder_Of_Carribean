You're one smart captain, hence before the expedition begins, you send a Pirate into the dense jungle of the island, in order to bring back a roughly sketched map of the jungle.

Before you know it, your Pirate is back with the Map. Shockingly, he is alive. (Lol)

Along with the directions, he informs you the number of habitable locations over the island, based of the number of Trees in each location.

An area of 3 locations combined together is termed as HABITABLE, if the sum of the trees in the 3 locations are not greater than the previous area calculated.

The first line of input contains an integer ùëõ ‚Äî the number of locations in the report.
The following set of N lines of input contains:
    - T, the number of trees in that particular location.

For example, suppose you had the following report:

10
199
200
208
210
200
207
240
269
260
263

This report indicates that the tree count is of 199, 200, 208, 210, and so on.

The first order of business is to figure out the number of trees in an area.

( A, B, C, D, E, F, G , H are areas)

199  A
200  A B
208  A B C
210    B C D
200  E   C D
207  E F   D
240  E F G
269    F G H
260      G H
263        H

Start by comparing the first and second areas. The tree count in the first area are marked A (199, 200, 208); their sum is 199 + 200 + 208 = 607. The second area is marked B (200, 208, 210); its sum is 618. The sum of measurements in the second area is larger than the sum of the first, so this first area is NOT HABITABLE.

Your goal now is to count the number of times the sum of 3 tree counts in this sliding window increases from the previous sum. So, compare A with B, then compare B with C, then C with D, and so on. Stop when there aren't enough measurements left to create a new three-measurement sum.

In the above example, the sum of each three location window is as follows:

A: 607 (N/A - no previous sum)
B: 618 (increased)
C: 618 (no change)
D: 617 (decreased)
E: 647 (increased)
F: 716 (increased)
G: 769 (increased)
H: 792 (increased)

In this example, there are 5 sums that are larger than the previous sum.

Hence there are 5 areas with are NOT HABITABLE.

Find the number of areas which are NOT HABITABLE.
